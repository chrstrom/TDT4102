# Assignments-TDT4102
A dump of all my assignments for the C++ introduction course "TDT4102" at NTNU. 

For starters:
1) Yes, the code is messy, I'm not much else than a novice C++ programmer, so take any code here with a grain of salt. 

2) Due to the nature of the assignments, the structure of a lot of the files will be off, with comments both in english and norwegian. Together with residue code from other parts of the assignment which I ended up having to comment out, so to not affect other parts of the program, the readability of the code is definitely sub-optimal.

3) God kok.
